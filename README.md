# MountainCar
This repository provides a simple C/C++ implementation of RL algorithms without using complex libraries.
At this time, SARSA and Q-learning are supported, and they are used to solve the Mountain Car problem.

It currently uses float32 arithmetic, but the goal is to use it to compare the efficiency of float and Posit numbers.
Hence, this program could become an example for a Posit library. However, no such library exists yet for ESP32-C3.
